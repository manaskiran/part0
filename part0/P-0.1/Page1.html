<p > <font  size=5 color= black face="arial"> Prior to their registration, the University may receive and process information from some students concerning the process of matriculation in the University. This is a process where students are required to demonstrate certain prior qualifications.

    The University receives and processes personal information about students following schemes of study leading to one or more of its awards from the Institution at which the student is studying. This information is collected for registration and examination purposes and normally comprises an electronic transfer of data. The University relies on its Institutions to establish the accuracy of the information but processes are in place to correct inaccuracies when they are identified.
    
    The University also receives and processes information directly from students and from persons requested by them to provide information in some circumstances. For instance, a student may request a medical report be sent in support of an appeal.
    
    Information may be provided by members of staff of an Institution concerning examination or assessment or in relation to a studentâ€™s own request for special variations where permitted by University Regulations or Standing Orders. Other information may be passed to the University in the case of appeals or requests for aegrotat award or similar standard processes.</font></p>
